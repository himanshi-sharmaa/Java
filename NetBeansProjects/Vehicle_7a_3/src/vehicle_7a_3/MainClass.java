 * Title:Create a base class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type string) and number of cylinders in the engine (type int). 
 * Then create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has additional properties: the load capacity in tons (type double since 
 * it may contain a fractional part) and towing capacity in pounds (type int).
 * Define a Car class that is derived from the Vehicle class and define a class called SportsCar that is derived from Car class.
* . Write a driver programs to test the Car and SportsCar classes.
 * Logic: MainClass is the driver class here.
 * Classes: MainClass,SportsCar,Truck,Car,vehicle_7a_3
 * Methods: main(),getters and setters for all the variables
 * Variables: manufName,noOfCylinders,loadCapacity,toweringCapacity
